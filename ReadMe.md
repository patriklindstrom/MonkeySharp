# MonkeySharp - Interpreter Exercise #

I listed to [hanselminuets podcast ](https://hanselminutes.com/586/you-should-write-an-interpreter-with-thorsten-ball) about writing your own [interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) written by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/). 
I bought the book and I am now trying to do it in C# instead.
The makeup language is called Monkey, hence solution name is MonkeySharp.
